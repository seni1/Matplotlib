Use single square brackets to print out the country column of cars as a Pandas Series.
Use double square brackets to print out the country column of cars as a Pandas DataFrame.
Use double square brackets to print out a DataFrame with both the country and drives_right columns of cars, in this order.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series
print(cars['country'])

# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame
print(cars[['country']])

# Print out DataFrame with country and drives_right columns
print(cars[['country','drives_right']])

-------------------

Select the first 3 observations from cars and print them out.
Select the fourth, fifth and sixth observation, corresponding to row indexes 3, 4 and 5, and print them out.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out first 3 observations
print(cars[:3])

# Print out fourth, fifth and sixth observation
print(cars[3:6])

---------------------

Use loc or iloc to select the observation corresponding to Japan as a Series. 
The label of this row is JPN, the index is 2. 
Make sure to print the resulting Series.
Use loc or iloc to select the observations for Australia and Egypt as a DataFrame. 
You can find out about the labels/indexes of these rows by inspecting cars in the IPython Shell. 
Make sure to print the resulting DataFrame.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.loc['JAP'])
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.iloc[[1, 6]])

----------------------

Print out the drives_right value of the row corresponding to Morocco (its row label is MOR)
Print out a sub-DataFrame, containing the observations for Russia and Morocco and the columns country and drives_right.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right value of Morocco
print(cars.loc['MOR', 'drives_right'])

# Print sub-DataFrame
print(cars.loc[['RU','MOR'], ['country', 'drives_right']])

-----------------------

Print out the drives_right column as a Series using loc or iloc.
Print out the drives_right column as a DataFrame using loc or iloc.
Print out both the cars_per_cap and drives_right column as a DataFrame using loc or iloc.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right column as Series
print(cars.loc[:, 'drives_right'])
print(cars.iloc[:,2])

# Print out drives_right column as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:, ['drives_right']])
print(cars.iloc[:,[2]])

# Print out cars_per_cap and drives_right as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:, ['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']])
print(cars.iloc[:,[0,2]])
