In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.

# Comparison of booleans
print(True == False)

# Comparison of integers
print(-5*15 != 75)

# Comparison of strings
print("pyscript" == "PyScript")

# Compare a boolean with an integer
print(True == 1)

-----------------------------

Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
"test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been defined for you.
True is greater than False.

# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(-10 <= x)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print('test'<= y)

# Comparison of booleans
print(True > False)

----------------------------

Using comparison operators, generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:

Which areas in my_house are greater than or equal to 18?
You can also compare two Numpy arrays element-wise. Which areas in my_house are smaller than the ones in your_house?
Make sure to wrap both commands in a print() statement so that you can inspect the output!

# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than or equal to 18
print(my_house >= 18)

# my_house less than your_house
print(my_house < your_house)
