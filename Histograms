Use plt.hist() to create a histogram of the values in life_exp. 
Do not specify the number of bins; Python will set the number of bins to 10 by default for you.
Add plt.show() to actually display the histogram. 
Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?

# Create histogram of life_exp data
plt.hist(life_exp)

# Display histogram
plt.show()

--------------------

Build a histogram of life_exp, with 5 bins. Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?
Build another histogram of life_exp, this time with 20 bins. Is this better?

# Build histogram with 5 bins
plt.hist(life_exp, 5)

# Show and clean up plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Build histogram with 20 bins
plt.hist(life_exp, 20)

# Show and clean up again
plt.show()
plt.clf()

-----------------------

Build a histogram of life_exp with 15 bins.
Build a histogram of life_exp1950, also with 15 bins. 
Is there a big difference with the histogram for the 2007 data?
