Use the index() method on countries to find the index of 'germany'. 
Store this index as ind_ger.
Use ind_ger to access the capital of Germany from the capitals list. 
Print it out.

# Definition of countries and capital
countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']

# Get index of 'germany': ind_ger
ind_ger = countries.index('germany')

# Use ind_ger to print out capital of Germany
print(capitals[ind_ger])


-------------------------

With the strings in countries and capitals, create a dictionary called europe with 4 key:value pairs. 
Beware of capitalization! 
Make sure you use lowercase characters everywhere.
Print out europe to see if the result is what you expected.

Create dictionary
The countries and capitals lists are again available in the script. It's your job to convert this data to a dictionary where the country names are the keys and the capitals are the corresponding values. As a refresher, here is a recipe for creating a dictionary:

my_dict = {
   "key1":"value1",
   "key2":"value2",
}
In this recipe, both the keys and the values are strings. This will also be the case for this exercise.

--------------------------

Check out which keys are in europe by calling the keys() method on europe. 
Print out the result.
Print out the value that belongs to the key 'norway'.

# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin', 'norway':'oslo' }

# Print out the keys in europe
print(europe.keys())

# Print out value that belongs to key 'norway'
print(europe['norway'])
