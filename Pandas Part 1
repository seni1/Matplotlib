Import pandas as pd.
Use the pre-defined lists to create a dictionary called my_dict. There should be three key value pairs:
key 'country' and value names.
key 'drives_right' and value dr.
key 'cars_per_cap' and value cpc.
Use pd.DataFrame() to turn your dict into a DataFrame called cars.
Print out cars and see how beautiful it is.


# Pre-defined lists
names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']
dr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]
cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]

# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Create dictionary my_dict with three key:value pairs: my_dict
my_dict = {'country':names, 'drives_right':dr, 'cars_per_cap':cpc}

# Build a DataFrame cars from my_dict: cars
cars = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)

# Print cars
print(cars)

---------------------------

Hit Run Code to see that, indeed, the row labels are not correctly set.
Specify the row labels by setting cars.index equal to row_labels.
Print out cars again and check if the row labels are correct this time.

import pandas as pd

# Build cars DataFrame
names = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']
dr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]
cpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]
dict = { 'country':names, 'drives_right':dr, 'cars_per_cap':cpc }
cars = pd.DataFrame(dict)
print(cars)

------------------------------

To import CSV files you still need the pandas package: import it as pd.
Use pd.read_csv() to import cars.csv data as a DataFrame. 
Store this dataframe as cars.
Print out cars. Does everything look OK?

# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Import the cars.csv data: cars
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Print out cars
print(cars)

----------------------

Run the code with Submit Answer and assert that the first column should actually be used as row labels.
Specify the index_col argument inside pd.read_csv(): set it to 0, so that the first column is used as row labels.
Has the printout of cars improved now?

# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Fix import by including index_col
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out cars
print(cars)
